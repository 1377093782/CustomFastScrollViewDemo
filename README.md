CustomFastScrollView Demo
=========================

Demo of an Android app showing a CustomFastScrollView with a larger window size than in the default FastScrollView.

In this example app, we have a list of countries sorted by their continent.  It is also possible to change the sorting by using the buttons at the bottom.
